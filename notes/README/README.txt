Welcome to UnderStudio, an Undertale engine made by Animelici804. Before getting started, please
read everything described in this file.

You are basically allowed to create fan-games and create tutorial videos. There are limits, of
course, which is that getting revenue from any of your content IS NOT permitted. Since I, and
the team behind the work of the engine does not get any money from it, and it IS NOT permitted
to get any revenue from Undertale fan-games, you are NOT allowed to do it at all costs.

Another limit is that you SHOULD credit our hard work. When you are using UnderStudio, you also
accept that you are GOING TO credit the team behind the work of the engine.

We may proceed to do legal actions towards your fan-game if any rule IS NOT being obeyed. Many
people not obeying it will make the engine private and it will never be public again.
In short, here is what you CAN and CANNOT do;

CAN DO;
- Make tutorial videos about the engine (partly tutorial videos, how to create a monster, etc.)
- Create fan-games with a limitation to credit our work.

CANNOT DO;
- Get any kind of revenue from your fan-games (ads, real price, etc.)
- Not crediting our work
- Distributing the engine (you may simply give the official GitHub link, though)
