<h3 align="center">Important Aspects</h3>
<p>1. UnderStudio has different types of folder names, which the "Core Engine" being the API, and "The Game" being the folder that can be used for the desired fan-game.</p>
<p>2. UnderStudio uses small portion of assets from TS!US (Monster Particle, Writing System, etc.) with the help from <a href="https://github.com/colinator27" target="_blank">Colinator27</a>.</p>
<p>3. UnderStudio currently has several outdated features that are going to be replaced with newer and optimized codes.</p>
<p>4. It is currently supported for the beta version of Game Maker: Studio 2.3.x and is recommended to wait for support for older versions of Game Maker: Studio</p>
<p>5. The engine is public to anyone unless a majority of people don't give any credit to our hard work.
